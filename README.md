# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **DEPI Internship Program** and serves as a **graduation project**.  
The main objective is to perform a thorough **analysis** of customer churn behavior within a telecom company and build **predictive models** capable of identifying customers at risk of leaving the service.

## Project Structure

The project workflow is organized into the following stages:

1. **Data Inspection and Cleaning**  
   - Checking for missing values and inconsistencies
   - Cleaning and formatting the dataset for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing churn distribution
   - Analyzing relationships between features and customer churn

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features if necessary
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets

4. **Modeling and Evaluation**  
   - Building classification models to predict churn
   - Evaluating models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

*(Details on modeling and results will be updated as the project progresses.)*
